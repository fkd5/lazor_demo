# lazor

"Lazor" is a game available on android and iphones. Its setup is similar to a board game. Multiple blocks are provided on the board (that may or may not be moved), in addition to lasers. The goals of the player is to move the available blocks to reflect or refract the lasers so that they hit the specified "sources"on the board. 

To run, open up the file "solver.py" and choose which board to run. There are 9 boards to choose from. There are different kinds of blocks or spaces on the board for different functions: 
x - no block allowed
o - blocks allowed 
A - fixed reflect block
B - fixed opaque block
C - fixed refract block
a - movable reflect block
b - movable opaque block
c - moveable refract block

This Lazor solver has been completed by Fiona Daley and Monika Wiktorzak. As a reminder, we are only a group of 2 for this assignment that typical contains a group of 3.
